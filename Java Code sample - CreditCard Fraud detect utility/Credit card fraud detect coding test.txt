Consider the following credit card fraud detection algorithm

     A credit card transaction is comprised of the following elements;

      + hashed credit card number
      + timestamp - of format 'year-month-dayThourminutesecond'
      + price - of format 'dollars.cents'

     Transactions are to be received as a comma separated string of elements eg. '10d7ce546456546547d1bbf8b1e2, 2013-04-28T101554, 10.00'

     A card transaction will be considered as fraudulent if the sum of prices for a unique hashed card number, for a given day, exceeds the price threshold.

Write a static method on a class, which, when given a list transactions, a date and a price threshold, returns a list of hashed credit card numbers that have been identified as fraudulent for that day.
